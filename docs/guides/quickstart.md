# Quickstart Guide

Get started with phasecurvefit in 5 minutes!

phasecurvefit takes points in phase space (positions *and* velocities) whose
order along a curve is unknown, and works out that order. This guide covers the
first step, **ordering** the points: first with the default pipeline, an MST
backbone refined by a SOM, then with the local-flow walk and the settings that
control it. The [Autoencoder guide](nn.md) covers the next step: giving
every point an ordering coordinate and fitting a smooth track. For worked
examples on realistic data, see the [tutorials](../tutorials/index.md).

## Installation

Install phasecurvefit using pip or uv:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} pip
```bash
pip install phasecurvefit
```
:::

:::{tab-item} uv
```bash
uv add phasecurvefit
```
:::

::::

```{note}
The plain pip/uv install above ships a **CPU-only** `jaxlib`. If you have an
NVIDIA GPU and see phasecurvefit or JAX fall back to CPU, see
[Installing for GPU](jax-integration.md#installing-for-gpu-nvidia-cuda) in
the JAX Integration guide.
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Import the library

```{code-cell} python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf
```

### 2. Prepare your phase-space data

Phase-space data is represented as two dictionaries:
- **position**: Maps coordinate names to position arrays
- **velocity**: Maps coordinate names to velocity arrays

Any number of dimensions works. As an example, take 100 points on a 3D helix,
shuffled so the order is unknown:

```{code-cell} python
import jax

t = jax.random.permutation(jax.random.key(0), jnp.linspace(0, 4 * jnp.pi, 100))

position = {
    "x": jnp.cos(t),
    "y": jnp.sin(t),
    "z": t / (2 * jnp.pi),
}

velocity = {
    "x": -jnp.sin(t),
    "y": jnp.cos(t),
    "z": jnp.ones_like(t) / (2 * jnp.pi),
}
```

Connecting the points in their stored order shows they are scrambled:

```{code-cell} python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(projection="3d")
ax.set_box_aspect(None, zoom=0.85)
ax.plot(position["x"], position["y"], position["z"], "-o", ms=3, lw=0.5)
ax.set(xlabel="x", ylabel="y", zlabel="z", title="Input order");
```

### 3. Run the algorithm

With no further arguments, `pcf.order` runs the **default pipeline**: an MST
backbone (the longest path of a minimum spanning tree of the nearest-neighbour
graph, which runs from one end of the curve to the other) refined by a
Self-Organizing Map. It needs no start point, and it orients the ordering along
the velocity.

```{code-cell} python
result = pcf.order(position, velocity)

print(result.ordering[:5])
assert result.gamma_range == (-1.0, 1.0)  # the default pipeline's, not the walk's
```

Connecting the points in the recovered order traces the helix:

```{code-cell} python
ordered_pos, ordered_vel = pcf.order_w(result)

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(projection="3d")
ax.set_box_aspect(None, zoom=0.85)
ax.plot(ordered_pos["x"], ordered_pos["y"], ordered_pos["z"], "-o", ms=3, lw=1)
ax.set(xlabel="x", ylabel="y", zlabel="z", title="Recovered order");
```

The SOM needs at least 15 tracers (its default number of prototypes) to fit; with
fewer, `pcf.order` returns the MST ordering alone.
See [The default pipeline](orderers.md#the-default-pipeline-mst-then-som).

#### The local-flow walk

To follow the velocity field step by step instead, pass a
{class}`~phasecurvefit.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer`. The walk starts at one point and repeatedly steps to the unvisited
point that minimizes a distance metric. With the default
`AlignedMomentumDistanceMetric`, that distance combines closeness with a penalty
for the direction *to* the candidate point being misaligned with the current
point's velocity — so the walk favors candidates that are close and roughly
**ahead of it**, but a sufficiently closer point off to the side can still win.
(Other metrics have no such directional penalty; see the
[Metrics guide](metrics.md).) It needs two choices from you:

- **Where to start** (`start_idx`). Start at one end of the curve. For a stream
  that flows *away* from a central point, such as a tidal stream from its
  progenitor, start at that point and walk both ways (`direction="both"`, below).
  If you don't know either, an `MSTOrderer` can find an end for you; see
  [Letting the MST find the walk's start point](orderers.md#letting-the-mst-find-the-walks-start-point).
- **How strongly to prefer "ahead"** (`metric_scale`), explained in
  [Adjusting the Metric Scale](#adjusting-the-metric-scale).

Here we start at the bottom of the helix; the walk examples below reuse `start`:

```{code-cell} python
start = int(jnp.argmin(position["z"]))

result = pcf.order(
    position,
    velocity,
    pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(
        start_idx=start,  # Start from one end of the curve
        metric_scale=1.0,  # Metric-dependent scale parameter
    ),
)

print(result.ordering[:5])
```

```{note}
Above we ran the **local-flow walk** through `pcf.order` with a
{class}`~phasecurvefit.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer` — one of several pluggable
orderers, and not the default. See the [Orderers guide](orderers.md). The rest of
this page is about the walk's settings.
```

### 4. Extract ordered data

Use the convenience function to get reordered arrays:

```{code-cell} python
ordered_pos, ordered_vel = pcf.order_w(result)

# The helix climbs monotonically in z once ordered
climbs = jnp.all(jnp.diff(ordered_pos["z"]) > 0)
print(climbs)
assert climbs
```

## Understanding the Result

`pcf.order` returns an `OrderingResult` (a `WalkLocalFlowResult` for the walk) with:

- **`ordering`**: the indices of the visited observations, in order
- **`indices`**: the same, padded with `-1` to the full length (a fixed shape, for JAX)
- **`n_visited`** / **`n_skipped`**: how many observations the orderer reached or left out
- **`positions`**, **`velocities`**: the input data
- **`gamma_range`**: the range of the ordering coordinate $\gamma$

Calling the result, `result(gamma)`, interpolates positions along the ordering.


## Adjusting the Metric Scale

The `metric_scale` parameter controls how the algorithm weighs different aspects
of the data. Its meaning depends on the distance metric. With the default
`AlignedMomentumDistanceMetric` it is a **length**, $\lambda$: a candidate point
at angle $\theta$ from the current velocity costs an extra
$\lambda\,(1 - \cos\theta)$ on top of its distance. So compare it with the
typical spacing between neighbouring points:

- $\lambda$ much smaller than the spacing: essentially nearest-neighbour; the walk
  goes wherever the closest point is.
- $\lambda$ about the spacing: a neighbour at 90° costs as much as a point twice as
  far away straight ahead.
- $\lambda$ much larger than the spacing: strongly directional; the walk keeps
  going the way it is moving, taking longer strides and skipping points off to
  the side. (The [stream autoencoder tutorial](../tutorials/stream_autoencoder.ipynb)
  uses 100 kpc against steps of a few kpc at most.)

Raise `metric_scale` if the walk jumps between neighbouring strands; lower it if
it skips too much. See the [Metrics guide](metrics.md#choosing-metric_scale) for
the other metrics.

```{code-cell} python
# With the default metric, metric_scale=0 switches off the momentum penalty:
# pure nearest neighbor
result_spatial = pcf.order(
    position, velocity, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=start, metric_scale=0.0)
)

# Balanced (default)
result_balanced = pcf.order(
    position, velocity, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=start, metric_scale=1.0)
)

# Higher metric_scale value (interpretation metric-dependent)
result_momentum = pcf.order(
    position, velocity, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=start, metric_scale=5.0)
)
```

## Walking in Reverse

Use the `direction` parameter to trace phase curves backwards by negating the velocity vectors:

```{code-cell} python
# Default: forward walk following the velocity direction
result_forward = pcf.order(
    position, velocity, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=start, metric_scale=1.0)
)

# Reverse: walk against the velocity direction
result_reverse = pcf.order(
    position,
    velocity,
    pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=start, metric_scale=1.0, direction="backward"),
)
```

This is useful for tracing stellar streams from the tidal tail back towards the progenitor.

## Configuring the Query

Use `WalkConfig` to configure the distance metric and query strategy:

```{code-cell} python
from phasecurvefit.metrics import AlignedMomentumDistanceMetric

# Configure with aligned momentum metric and KD-tree strategy
config = pcf.WalkConfig(
    metric=AlignedMomentumDistanceMetric(),
    strategy=pcf.strats.KDTree(k=5),
)

result = pcf.order(
    position,
    velocity,
    pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(config=config, start_idx=start, metric_scale=1.0),
)
```

## Handling Gaps with max_dist

Use `max_dist` to stop when there's a gap in the data. It is a plain spatial
distance: the walk stops if the step it would take next is longer than
`max_dist`, so it does not leap across a gap onto an unrelated part of the data.
Set it to several times the typical spacing between neighbouring points. The
points the walk never reaches are reported as skipped; the
[autoencoder](nn.md) can assign them an ordering afterwards.

```{code-cell} python
# Stop if next nearest point is more than 2 units away
result = pcf.order(
    position,
    velocity,
    pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(
        start_idx=start,
        metric_scale=1.0,
        max_dist=2.0,
    ),
)

# Check if any points were skipped
if result.n_skipped > 0:
    print(f"Skipped {result.n_skipped} points")
```

## Bidirectional Walks (Forward and Reverse)

For streams that extend in both directions from a starting point, walk both ways
from it with `direction="both"`:

```{code-cell} python
# Walk forward and backward from index 2, stitched into one ordering
result = pcf.order(
    position,
    velocity,
    pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=2, metric_scale=1.0, direction="both"),
)

# Get the combined ordered indices
print(result.indices)  # Indices ordered from reverse tail through start to forward tail

# Extract the ordered positions and velocities
ordered_pos, ordered_vel = pcf.order_w(result)
```

This is particularly useful for:

- Tracing complete stellar streams from a central progenitor
- Exploring both tidal tails simultaneously

To use different parameters in each direction (e.g. different `max_dist`), run the
two walks separately and join them with `pcf.combine_results`; see the
[Algorithm guide](algorithm.md#combining-forward-and-reverse-walks).

## JAX Integration

The algorithm is fully compatible with JAX transformations:

### JIT Compilation

```{code-cell} python
from functools import partial

from jax import jit


# start_idx is a static field of the orderer, so it is a static argument here
# (each new value recompiles).
@partial(jit, static_argnames="start_idx")
def order_stream(pos, vel, start_idx):
    return pcf.order(
        pos, vel, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=start_idx, metric_scale=1.0)
    )


result = order_stream(position, velocity, start_idx=start)
```

### Vectorization

To order many streams at once, stack them along a leading axis and `vmap` over
it; see [Vectorization](jax-integration.md#vectorization-vmap) in the JAX
Integration guide.
