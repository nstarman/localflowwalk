# JAX Integration

This guide shows how to use `phasecurvefit` with JAX for faster computation, batching, and differentiation.

```{note}
This guide covers the **local-flow walk**
({class}`~phasecurvefit.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer`), which is fully JAX-traceable,
so every example here names it explicitly. `pcf.order(pos, vel)` with **no**
orderer runs the default MST | SOM pipeline, which is *not* traceable under `jit`
or `vmap` (it raises a `TypeError` saying so): whether the SOM stage runs depends
on the visited count, and a SOM stage chained after another cannot be traced. The
{class}`~phasecurvefit.orderers.MSTOrderer` alone does trace: its exact kNN runs in JAX through its `neighbors` backend (default {class}`~phasecurvefit.neighbors.BucketKDTree`), and only the graph algorithms run host-side (SciPy) through `jax.pure_callback`. {class}`~phasecurvefit.neighbors.SciPy` is faster on CPU but host-only: it raises `TypeError` when its inputs are traced (arguments of `jit`, `vmap` or `grad`). A result's
`__call__` interpolation is JAX-traceable whichever orderer produced it.
```

## Basic Usage

The library works seamlessly with JAX arrays—no special setup needed:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf

# Phase-space data
position = {"x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])}
velocity = {"x": jnp.array([1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3])}

# Direct call works
result = pcf.order(
    position, velocity, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=0, metric_scale=1.0)
)
```

The dict-based API is JAX PyTree compatible, so it works seamlessly with JAX transformations.

## JIT Compilation

Wrap the function to enable JIT compilation for faster repeated calls:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf


# Wrap for JIT
@jax.jit
def order_stream(position, velocity):
    return pcf.order(
        position, velocity, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=0, metric_scale=1.0)
    )


# Data
position = {"x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])}
velocity = {"x": jnp.array([1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3])}

# First call: compiles; subsequent calls use cached version
result = order_stream(position, velocity)
```

**Note**: JIT is most beneficial when calling the same function repeatedly with similar shapes.

## Vectorization (vmap)

Process multiple streams in parallel:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf
from jaxmore import vmap  # a better vmap

# Multiple streams
streams_pos = [
    {"x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0])},
    {"x": jnp.array([3.0, 4.0, 5.0])},
    {"x": jnp.array([6.0, 7.0, 8.0])},
]
streams_vel = [
    {"x": jnp.array([1.0, 1.1, 1.2])},
    {"x": jnp.array([1.3, 1.4, 1.5])},
    {"x": jnp.array([1.6, 1.7, 1.8])},
]

# Stack arrays
stacked_pos = {"x": jnp.stack([s["x"] for s in streams_pos])}
stacked_vel = {"x": jnp.stack([s["x"] for s in streams_vel])}

# Apply vmap over batch dimension
batched_fn = vmap(
    pcf.order,
    in_axes=(0, 0),
    static_kw={"orderer": pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=0, metric_scale=1.0)},
)
results = batched_fn(stacked_pos, stacked_vel)
print(f"Processed {results.indices.shape[0]} streams in parallel")
```

For a list of independent streams, use `jax.tree.map`:

```python
streams = [
    {"q": {"x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0])}, "p": {"x": jnp.array([1.0, 1.1])}},
    {"q": {"x": jnp.array([3.0, 4.0])}, "p": {"x": jnp.array([1.3, 1.4])}},
]

results = jax.tree.map(
    lambda sd: pcf.order(
        sd["q"], sd["p"], pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=0, metric_scale=1.0)
    ),
    streams,
    is_leaf=lambda x: isinstance(x, dict),
)
```

## Differentiation

The ordering itself is discrete: it is a list of integer indices, so its
gradient with respect to anything (the data, `metric_scale`, …) is zero. What is
differentiable is everything computed *from* the ordering with real numbers,
such as positions interpolated along it (`result(gamma)`) or the autoencoder's
outputs. Here the loss depends on the interpolated track, and the gradient flows
back to the input positions with the ordering held fixed:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf

position = {"x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])}
velocity = {"x": jnp.array([1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3])}
orderer = pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=0, metric_scale=1.0)


# A scalar loss on the track interpolated along the ordering
def loss_fn(pos):
    result = pcf.order(pos, velocity, orderer)
    track = result(jnp.linspace(0.0, 1.0, 5))
    return jnp.sum(track["x"] ** 2)


# Gradient with respect to the input positions
value, grads = jax.value_and_grad(loss_fn)(position)
print(f"Loss: {value}, d(loss)/dx: {grads['x']}")
```

## Performance Tips

**Use JAX arrays**: Convert NumPy arrays to JAX before calling:

```python
import numpy as np

# NumPy data
pos_numpy = {"x": np.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])}
vel_numpy = {"x": np.array([1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3])}

# Convert to JAX
pos_jax = jax.tree.map(jnp.asarray, pos_numpy)
vel_jax = jax.tree.map(jnp.asarray, vel_numpy)
result = pcf.order(
    pos_jax, vel_jax, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=0, metric_scale=1.0)
)
```

**Combine JIT and vmap**: For batched operations that run repeatedly, wrap both:

```python
@jax.jit
def batch_order(stacked_pos, stacked_vel):
    return vmap(
        pcf.order,
        in_axes=(0, 0),
        static_kw={
            "orderer": pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=0, metric_scale=1.0)
        },
    )(stacked_pos, stacked_vel)
```

## Hardware Acceleration

The library works on GPU/TPU with no code changes — but only once JAX itself
can see the accelerator.

### Installing for GPU (NVIDIA CUDA)

A plain `pip install phasecurvefit` (or `jax`) installs a **CPU-only**
`jaxlib`. If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you'll see JAX print:

```text
An NVIDIA GPU may be present on this machine, but a CUDA-enabled jaxlib is
not installed. Falling back to cpu.
```

Install JAX's CUDA-enabled build alongside phasecurvefit to fix this:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} pip
```bash
pip install --upgrade "phasecurvefit[all]" "jax[cuda12]"
```
`--upgrade` ensures pip actually swaps in the CUDA-enabled `jaxlib` even if a
CPU-only one is already installed.
:::

:::{tab-item} uv
```bash
uv add phasecurvefit --extra all
uv add "jax[cuda12]"
```
:::

::::

This pulls in self-contained NVIDIA CUDA/cuDNN wheels — you don't need the
CUDA toolkit installed system-wide — but you do still need a
[compatible NVIDIA driver](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#nvidia-gpu)
for your GPU. See the
[JAX GPU installation guide](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#nvidia-gpu)
for other CUDA versions or platforms (TPU, ROCm).

Once installed, no code changes are needed:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf

position = {"x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])}
velocity = {"x": jnp.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0])}

# Check available devices
devices = jax.devices()
print(f"Available devices: {devices}")

# Computation automatically runs on GPU/TPU if available
result = pcf.order(
    position, velocity, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=0, metric_scale=1.0)
)
```

## Debugging Tips

**Disable JIT**: For easier debugging, disable JIT compilation:

```python
import jax

with jax.disable_jit():
    result = pcf.order(
        position, velocity, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(start_idx=0, metric_scale=1.0)
    )
```

**Check shapes**: Verify array shapes in dicts:

```python
import jax

print(jax.tree.map(lambda x: x.shape, position))
```
