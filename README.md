Construct paths through phase-Space points, supporting many different
algorithms.

## Why phasecurvefit?

Many datasets are samples along a curve in phase space whose order along the
curve is unknown. Before fitting a model to such a curve you need two things: an
ordering coordinate for every sample, and a smooth track through them. Doing
this by hand, or with a position-only nearest-neighbor or clustering method,
breaks down in exactly the cases that matter:

- **Curves that cross or fold back on themselves.** Where two strands meet, the
  nearest point is often on the wrong strand. phasecurvefit uses velocities as
  well as positions, so the ordering stays on the right strand (see the
  [epitrochoid tutorials](https://phasecurvefit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/epitrochoid_autoencoder.html)).
- **No known starting point.** The default MST | SOM pipeline finds the two ends
  of the curve itself, so no progenitor position or hand-picked start index is
  needed
  ([MST tutorial](https://phasecurvefit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/stream_mst.html)).
- **Incomplete orderings.** An orderer may order only a reliable subset (the
  local-flow walk does); an autoencoder then assigns an ordering coordinate γ to
  every sample and learns a smooth mean track through them
  ([stream autoencoder tutorial](https://phasecurvefit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/stream_autoencoder.html)).
- **Contamination.** A stream-plus-background mixture model gives each sample a
  calibrated membership probability, so interlopers can be down-weighted or
  removed
  ([outlier-rejection tutorial](https://phasecurvefit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/outlier_rejection.html)).
- **Use inside larger models.** phasecurvefit is built on JAX: the walk, the
  distance metrics and the neural networks work with `jit`, `vmap` and `grad`
  and run on CPU or GPU. A training-free running-mean track is available when
  speed matters more than accuracy, for example inside a likelihood evaluated at
  every step of an MCMC
  ([running-mean tutorial](https://phasecurvefit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/stream_runningmean.html)).

phasecurvefit is a reusable, tested library for ordering samples along a curve
in phase space, by default with an MST backbone refined by a Self-Organizing
Map, with alternative orderers (including momentum-weighted ordering), gap
filling, outlier rejection and optional physical units (via `unxt`). It was
built for stellar streams but applies to any ordered phase-space data.

## Features

- **JAX-powered**: Fully compatible with JAX transformations (`jit`, `vmap`,
  `grad`)
- **GPU-ready**: Runs on CPU, GPU, or TPU via JAX
- **Type-safe**: Comprehensive (optionally runtime checked) type hints with
  `jaxtyping`
- **Pluggable metrics**: Customizable distance metrics for different physical
  interpretations
- **Pluggable query strategies**: Choose which neighbors each step may move to
  (e.g., all points, or only the k spatially nearest via a KD-tree)
- **Pluggable orderers**: One interface over multiple ordering algorithms — by
  default an MST backbone refined by a SOM, with the velocity-following walk as
  an alternative
- **Highly customizable ML setup and training**: Well-chosen defaults with
  highly flexible customization for specific use-cases.
- **Physical units**: Optional support via `unxt` for unit-aware calculations

## Installation

Install the core package:

```bash
pip install phasecurvefit[all]
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv add phasecurvefit[all]
```

<details>
  <summary>from source, using uv</summary>

```bash
uv add git+https://github.com/GalacticDynamics/phasecurvefit.git@main
```

You can customize the branch by replacing `main` with any other branch name.

<details>
  <summary>building from source</summary>

```bash
cd /path/to/parent
git clone https://github.com/GalacticDynamics/phasecurvefit.git
cd phasecurvefit
uv pip install -e .  # editable mode
```

</details>

### Optional Dependencies

phasecurvefit has optional dependencies for extended functionality:

- **unxt**: Physical units support for phase-space calculations
- **kdtree (jaxkd)**: KD-tree strategy that restricts each step to the k
  spatially nearest points

Install with optional dependencies:

```bash
# pip install phasecurvefit[all]  # Install with all extras
pip install phasecurvefit[interop]  # Install with unxt for unit support
pip install phasecurvefit[kdtree]  # Install with jaxkd for KD-tree strategy
```

Or with uv:

```bash
# uv add phasecurvefit --extra all  # installs all extras
uv add phasecurvefit --extra interop
uv add phasecurvefit --extra kdtree
```

### Running the Tutorials

The
[tutorial notebooks](https://phasecurvefit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html)
need packages beyond the runtime `[all]` extra — `matplotlib` for plotting and
`galax` for the mock-stream examples. Install them with the `tutorials` extra:

```bash
pip install phasecurvefit[tutorials]
```

```bash
uv add phasecurvefit --extra tutorials
```

Note `[all]` intentionally does not include `tutorials`: `all` covers optional
_runtime_ functionality, while `tutorials` covers packages only needed to run
the example notebooks.

### GPU Support (NVIDIA CUDA)

phasecurvefit runs on GPU through JAX, but a plain `pip install jax` (what
phasecurvefit depends on) only ships a CPU-only `jaxlib`. If you have an NVIDIA
GPU and see:

```text
An NVIDIA GPU may be present on this machine, but a CUDA-enabled jaxlib is
not installed. Falling back to cpu.
```

Install JAX's CUDA-enabled build alongside phasecurvefit:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "phasecurvefit[all]" "jax[cuda12]"
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv add phasecurvefit --extra all
uv add "jax[cuda12]"
```

This pulls in self-contained NVIDIA CUDA/cuDNN wheels — you don't need the CUDA
toolkit installed system-wide — but you do still need a
[compatible NVIDIA driver](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#nvidia-gpu)
for your GPU. `--upgrade` ensures pip actually swaps in the CUDA-enabled
`jaxlib` even if a CPU-only one is already installed. See the
[JAX GPU installation guide](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#nvidia-gpu)
for other CUDA versions or platforms (TPU, ROCm), and verify the install with:

```python
import jax

print(jax.devices())  # should list a CudaDevice, not just CpuDevice
```

## Quick Start

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf

# Create phase-space observations as dictionaries (Cartesian coordinates)
pos = {
    "x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]),
    "y": jnp.array([0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]),
}
vel = {
    "x": jnp.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]),
    "y": jnp.array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]),
}

# Step 1: Order the observations: an MST backbone refined by a SOM. (With fewer
# than 15 points, as here, the SOM is skipped and the MST is used alone.)
result = pcf.order(pos, vel)
print(result.indices)  # Initial ordering

# Step 2: Create normalizer and autoencoder
key = jax.random.key(0)
normalizer = pcf.nn.StandardScalerNormalizer(pos, vel)
autoencoder = pcf.nn.PathAutoencoder.make(
    normalizer, gamma_range=result.gamma_range, key=key
)

# Step 3: Configure and run training
train_config = pcf.nn.TrainingConfig(
    n_epochs_encoder=100,  # Encoder-only epochs
    n_epochs_both=50,  # Joint training epochs
    show_pbar=False,  # Disable progress bar
)

# Train the autoencoder
result, _, losses = pcf.nn.train_autoencoder(
    autoencoder, result, config=train_config, key=key
)

print(result.indices)  # Post-training ordering
```

### With Physical Units

When `unxt` is installed, you can use physical units throughout the workflow:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf
import unxt as u

# Create phase-space observations with units
pos = {
    "x": u.Q([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], "kpc"),
    "y": u.Q([0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0], "kpc"),
}
vel = {
    "x": u.Q([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "km/s"),
    "y": u.Q([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5], "km/s"),
}

# Step 1: Order with units (units are preserved throughout)
metric_scale = u.Q(1.0, "kpc")
config = pcf.WalkConfig(strategy=pcf.strats.KDTree(k=3))
result = pcf.order(
    pos,
    vel,
    pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(config=config, metric_scale=metric_scale),
    metadata=pcf.StateMetadata(usys=u.unitsystems.galactic),
)

# Step 2: Create normalizer and autoencoder (handles units automatically)
key = jax.random.key(0)
normalizer = pcf.nn.StandardScalerNormalizer(pos, vel)
autoencoder = pcf.nn.PathAutoencoder.make(
    normalizer, gamma_range=result.gamma_range, key=key
)
result, _, losses = pcf.nn.train_autoencoder(
    autoencoder, result, config=train_config, key=key
)
```

## Orderers

The ordering step is pluggable. Every orderer implements the same interface —
`order(positions, velocities)` — and returns an `OrderingResult` that feeds the
autoencoder unchanged, so orderers are interchangeable. With no orderer,
`pcf.order(pos, vel)` runs the **default pipeline**, an MST backbone refined by
a SOM (`MSTOrderer() | SOMOrderer()`). The built-in orderers it is made from,
and the alternative to them, are:

- **`MSTOrderer`** — a minimum-spanning-tree backbone. It needs no start point
  (the graph diameter finds the two tips itself), which makes it ideal for
  **near-closed loops** where the velocity field reverses and a single walk
  covers only one arm.
- **`SOMOrderer`** — a Self-Organizing Map refinement. Its prototypes average
  over many tracers, so the backbone it produces is far less sensitive to local
  noise than a single walk's or MST's individual decisions.
- **`LocalFlowOrderer`** — the velocity-following walk. Follows a coherent flow
  from a start point, and is fully JAX-traceable.

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf

# Points along a curve
t = jnp.linspace(0.0, 1.0, 60)
pos = {"x": 10.0 * t, "y": jnp.sin(3.0 * t)}
vel = {"x": jnp.ones(60), "y": 3.0 * jnp.cos(3.0 * t)}

# The default: MST backbone refined by a SOM (no start point needed)
result = pcf.order(pos, vel)

# The velocity-following walk, via the orderer interface
walk_orderer = pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(metric_scale=1.0, start_idx=0)
walk_result = walk_orderer.order(pos, vel)

# A custom chain: tune the MST, then refine with a SOM
chain = pcf.orderers.MSTOrderer(k=8, jump_cap=2.0) | pcf.orderers.SOMOrderer()
chain_result = pcf.order(pos, vel, chain)

# Either result feeds the autoencoder unchanged
print(result.gamma_range)  # (-1.0, 1.0)
```

`MSTOrderer` also has opt-in velocity mechanisms (`velocity_weight`,
`sever_cos_threshold`, `orient_by_velocity`) for self-overlapping streams. See
the
[Orderers Guide](https://phasecurvefit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/orderers.html)
and the
[v0.3 → v0.4 Migration Guide](https://phasecurvefit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration/v0.3-to-v0.4.html),
which covers the change of default from the walk to MST | SOM.

## Distance Metrics

The algorithm supports pluggable distance metrics to control how points are
ordered. The default metric is `AlignedMomentumDistanceMetric`, which combines
spatial proximity with velocity alignment:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf

# Define simple Cartesian arrays (not quantities)
pos = {"x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0]), "y": jnp.array([0.0, 0.5, 1.0])}
vel = {"x": jnp.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0]), "y": jnp.array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5])}

# Use default metric (AlignedMomentumDistanceMetric)
config = pcf.WalkConfig()
result = pcf.order(pos, vel, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(config=config))
```

### Using Different Metrics

`phasecurvefit` provides three built-in metrics:

1. **AlignedMomentumDistanceMetric** (default): Combines spatial distance with
   velocity alignment (momentum-weighted nearest neighbor)
2. **FullPhaseSpaceDistanceMetric**: True 6D Euclidean distance in phase space
3. **SpatialDistanceMetric**: Pure spatial distance, ignoring velocity

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf

# Define simple Cartesian arrays (not quantities)
pos = {"x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0]), "y": jnp.array([0.0, 0.5, 1.0])}
vel = {"x": jnp.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0]), "y": jnp.array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5])}

# Pure spatial ordering (ignores velocity)
config_spatial = pcf.WalkConfig(metric=pcf.metrics.SpatialDistanceMetric())
result = pcf.order(
    pos, vel, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(config=config_spatial, metric_scale=0.0)
)

# Full 6D phase-space distance
config_phase = pcf.WalkConfig(metric=pcf.metrics.FullPhaseSpaceDistanceMetric())
result = pcf.order(pos, vel, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(config=config_phase))
```

### Custom Metrics

You can define custom metrics by subclassing `AbstractDistanceMetric`:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf


class WeightedPhaseSpaceMetric(pcf.metrics.AbstractDistanceMetric):
    """Custom weighted phase-space metric."""

    def __call__(self, current_pos, current_vel, positions, velocities, metric_scale):
        # Compute position distance
        pos_diff = jax.tree.map(jnp.subtract, positions, current_pos)
        pos_dist_sq = sum(jax.tree.leaves(jax.tree.map(jnp.square, pos_diff)))

        # Compute velocity distance
        vel_diff = jax.tree.map(jnp.subtract, velocities, current_vel)
        vel_dist_sq = sum(jax.tree.leaves(jax.tree.map(jnp.square, vel_diff)))

        # Custom weighting scheme
        return jnp.sqrt(pos_dist_sq + (metric_scale**2) * vel_dist_sq)


# Use custom metric via WalkConfig
config = pcf.WalkConfig(metric=WeightedPhaseSpaceMetric())
result = pcf.order(pos, vel, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(config=config))
```

See the
[Metrics Guide](https://phasecurvefit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/metrics.html)
for more details and examples.

## Query Strategies

The algorithm supports pluggable query strategies to control how neighbors are
found. A strategy determines which points are considered as potential next steps
in the walk.

`phasecurvefit` provides two built-in strategies:

1. **BruteForce** (default): Compute distances to all remaining points and
   select the nearest one.
2. **KDTree**: Restrict each step's candidates to the `k` spatially nearest
   points, then select by the metric (requires optional `jaxkd` dependency).
   Each step costs O(k) instead of O(n), after a one-off batched KD-tree query
   that builds every point's neighbor list. On CPU that setup dominates, so it
   beats `BruteForce` only on large datasets (tens of thousands of points and
   up).

### Using Built-in Strategies

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf

# Define simple Cartesian arrays
pos = {"x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0]), "y": jnp.array([0.0, 0.5, 1.0])}
vel = {"x": jnp.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0]), "y": jnp.array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5])}

# Default strategy (brute-force — no configuration needed)
config_brute = pcf.WalkConfig(strategy=pcf.strats.BruteForce())
result = pcf.order(pos, vel, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(config=config_brute))

# KD-tree strategy: only the k spatially nearest points are candidates
config_kdtree = pcf.WalkConfig(strategy=pcf.strats.KDTree(k=2))
result = pcf.order(pos, vel, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(config=config_kdtree))
```

### Custom Query Strategies

You can define custom strategies by subclassing `AbstractQueryStrategy`:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import phasecurvefit as pcf


class SmallestIndexStrategy(pcf.strats.AbstractQueryStrategy):
    """Custom strategy: select the smallest unvisited index.

    This is a toy example showing how to implement a custom strategy.
    By returning uniform distances, argmin selects the smallest index
    deterministically. In practice, distance-based strategies like BruteForce
    are more useful.
    """

    def init(self, positions, /, *, metadata):
        """No persistent state needed."""
        return None

    def query(
        self,
        state,
        /,
        current_pos,
        current_vel,
        positions,
        velocities,
        metric_fn,
        metric_scale,
    ):
        """Return uniform distances to all points.

        Since all distances are equal, the walk algorithm's argmin will
        deterministically select the smallest unvisited index.
        """
        # Get number of points
        n_points = len(next(iter(positions.values())))

        # Return uniform distances to all points
        # argmin will pick the smallest unvisited index
        distances = jnp.ones(n_points)

        return pcf.strats.QueryResult(distances=distances, indices=None)


# Use custom strategy via WalkConfig
config = pcf.WalkConfig(strategy=SmallestIndexStrategy())
result = pcf.order(pos, vel, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer(config=config))
```
