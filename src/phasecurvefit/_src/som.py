r"""Self-Organizing Map core, in pure JAX.

A 1-D SOM learns ``K`` prototype vectors in phase space whose lattice indices
carry the ordering: prototypes ``i`` and ``j`` are neighbours iff ``|i - j| = 1``
(Starkman et al. 2023, Appendix A). Training moves the prototypes onto the data;
projecting the data back onto the prototype polyline yields an arc-length
*chord* parameter that orders the observations.

Everything in this module is a pure function of explicit arrays with static
shapes, so it is jit- and vmap-traceable. No host callbacks, no Python
branching on traced values, no dynamic shapes.

    lattice. The update replaces the paper's online form (A9)/(A10): there is no
    learning rate. This batch form is the fixed point of the conventional
    online Kohonen update, whose increment is proportional to ``w - p^(k)``
    (:doc:`/guides/som` notes how that differs from (A9) as printed). ``omega_n``
    is ``weights``, defaulting to ``1`` for every datum -- the paper has no such
    term, so this is an addition, not a further deviation from (A9)/(A10): with
    the default, the sum above is exactly the un-weighted one.

    ``sigma`` anneals geometrically from ``sigma_start`` to ``sigma_end``, so the
    global ordering forms first and local detail is refined afterwards.
    ``sigma_end`` is reached on the *last* epoch, so ``n_epochs=1`` runs its one
    epoch at ``sigma_start`` and never narrows; pass ``sigma_start=sigma_end``
    to train a single epoch at the final width.

    Setting ``outlier_clip_sigma`` layers on iterated, robust rejection of
    quantization-error outliers, mirroring
    :attr:`~phasecurvefit.orderers.MSTOrderer.edge_clip_sigma` /
    ``edge_clip_max_iters`` in both mechanism and iteration, applied to each
    datum's distance to its best-matching unit (:func:`bmu_distance`) rather
    than MST edge length. Each iteration:

    1. refits with the current per-datum weight (``1`` for a kept datum, ``0``
       for a rejected one -- so rejected data stop pulling on any prototype
       without changing any array's shape);
    2. among the still-kept data, in log space (distances are positive and
       heavy-tailed): computes the median and a robust spread
       (``1.4826 * MAD``), then rejects everything beyond
       ``median + max(outlier_clip_sigma * spread, log(2))`` -- the floor
       keeps a well-fit lattice, where the spread collapses to ~0, from being
       shredded by microscopic quantization-error variation;
    3. stops when a round rejects nothing new, or after
       ``outlier_clip_max_iters`` rounds, whichever first -- a rejection is
       never undone once made.

    There is no graph here, so there is no analogue of MST's component-size
    veto (a long edge that would fragment the graph is kept); a quantization
    error is a per-datum quantity, not shared between data, so nothing here
    can "reconnect" the way a spared MST edge can.

    Parameters
    ----------
    proto_positions, proto_velocities
        Initial prototypes, shape ``(K,)`` per component.
    positions, velocities
        The data, shape ``(N,)`` per component.
    metric
        Any *symmetric* :class:`~phasecurvefit.metrics.AbstractDistanceMetric`;
        see :class:`~phasecurvefit.orderers.SOMOrderer` for which, and why.
    metric_scale
        Scale parameter handed to ``metric``; see
        :class:`~phasecurvefit.orderers.SOMOrderer`.
    n_epochs
        Number of batch updates. Static.
    sigma_start
        Initial neighbourhood width in lattice units. ``None`` uses
        ``max(K / 4, sigma_end)``, i.e. ``K / 4`` floored at ``sigma_end`` so
        the anneal is never inverted on a very small lattice.
    sigma_end
        Final neighbourhood width in lattice units.
    weights
        Per-datum weight ``omega_n`` in the update above, shape ``(N,)``.
        ``None`` (default) weighs every datum equally. A datum weighted ``0``
        contributes to no prototype's update without changing any array's
        shape. Mutually exclusive with ``outlier_clip_sigma``, which computes
        its own weights round by round.
    outlier_clip_sigma
        Robust-sigma threshold in log space for outlier rejection. ``None``
        (default) disables it -- ``fit`` then runs exactly one batch-Kohonen
        pass, as if ``outlier_clip_sigma`` never existed. Otherwise must be
        positive.
    outlier_clip_max_iters
        Maximum number of refit-and-reclip rounds when ``outlier_clip_sigma``
        is set. Static; must be >= 1. Unused otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    FitResult
        Trained prototype positions and velocities, and a boolean ``(N,)``
        ``kept`` mask -- all-``True`` unless ``outlier_clip_sigma`` rejected
        something. A named result rather than a bare tuple so adding
        ``outlier_clip_sigma`` never changed how many values this function
        returns.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
    >>> import phasecurvefit as pcf

    >>> bool(jnp.all(jnp.diff(result.prototype_positions["x"]) > 0))
    True
    >>> bool(jnp.all(result.kept))
    True

    With one wild outlier, ``outlier_clip_sigma`` finds it:

    >>> pos_c = dict(pos)
    >>> pos_c["y"] = pos_c["y"].at[25].set(50.0)

    Draws ``n_obs`` indices with replacement and returns how often each datum
    was drawn. Handed to ``fit`` as ``weights`` this *is* a bootstrap resample:
    a datum drawn twice counts twice in the neighbourhood-weighted mean, and
    one never drawn counts not at all. Roughly ``1/e`` of the data is left out
    of any member, which is where an ensemble's spread comes from.

    This exists because ``vmap`` alone does not give you an ensemble. Batch
    Kohonen replaces each prototype outright with a mean of the data, so a
    prototype survives only through which datum it wins; members that agree on
    their assignments stay merged for every later epoch, and perturbing a
    shared initialization converges to bit-identical members. The diversity has
    to come from the data.

    Counts rather than gathered indices, because counts keep every array at
    shape ``(N,)``: an ensemble is a ``vmap`` over an ``(M, N)`` weight matrix
    with the data passed once, not ``M`` copies of the data.

    Densifying to a C1 curve is what removes the paper's 2-D "convexity" case.

    vertex receives the same arc length -- a tie the paper broke with an
    ``arctan2`` angle sweep that does not generalize past 2-D. On a smooth curve

    factor
        Samples per prototype segment; the result has ``factor * (K - 1) + 1``
        vertices. ``factor=1`` still evaluates the spline, but at one sample
        per segment, which reproduces the prototypes to float32 rounding -- so
        it smooths nothing. It does **not** skip the arc-length
        resampling, so the result is a polyline whose vertices are redistributed
        to equal spacing rather than the prototypes themselves -- on unevenly
        spaced prototypes it cuts corners, and a corner prototype can end up off

        Raising it buys down the interior geometric error but not the
        error in the first and last segments: the duplicated end stencil gives
        the phantom knot a near-zero spacing, so the parameterization stalls at
        the tips and those two segments keep a fixed error floor. The tips are

    """Project data onto the backbone and return the arc-length chord parameter.

    This is the N-dimensional generalization of the paper's Section 2.2.2. Each
    datum is assigned to its nearest backbone vertex **under** ``metric``, and
    then refined to sub-vertex resolution **in position space**, where
    projection onto a segment is actually defined.

    Whether that assignment is velocity-aware depends on ``metric`` and
    ``metric_scale``. At the default ``metric_scale=0.0`` the phase-space
    metric reduces to pure position distance, so anti-parallel arms of a
    near-closed loop can capture each other; :doc:`/guides/som` gives the
    contamination rates and :class:`~phasecurvefit.orderers.SOMOrderer` covers
    choosing a scale.

    The split is forced: a metric such as
    :class:`~phasecurvefit.metrics.AlignedMomentumDistanceMetric` is not induced
    by an inner product, so "project onto a line segment" has no meaning under
    it. The metric therefore chooses *which* segment; Euclidean position
    geometry chooses *where* within it. The returned chord is consequently a
    genuine physical arc length along the track, computed as true cumulative arc
    length over the backbone -- which need not be arc-length-uniform
    (:func:`densify` produces one that is, but this function does not assume
    it).

    Returns
    -------
    Float[Array, " N"]
        Arc length per observation, in input order. Values outside
        ``[0, L]`` are data beyond the tips (see ``_segment_projection``).
