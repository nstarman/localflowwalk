"""The pluggable orderer abstraction.

An *orderer* consumes phase-space tracers ``(positions, velocities)`` and returns
an :class:`~phasecurvefit._src.abstract_result.AbstractResult` (in practice an
:class:`~phasecurvefit._src.orderers.result.OrderingResult`) that the
autoencoder consumes unchanged.

Contract
--------
``order()`` is a one-shot, **host-side** preprocessing step: it is *not* required
to be jit/vmap-traceable (this lets ``MSTOrderer`` use plain NumPy/SciPy). It
returns arrays the AE consumes directly: plain ``jnp`` arrays for array inputs,
or unit-aware ``unxt`` Quantities when given Quantity inputs (via the ``unxt``
interop). ``indices`` stores visited observation indices in visit order as a
prefix of length ``n_visited``, with all remaining entries set to ``-1``;
``gamma_range`` is static.

    """Arc length along the ordered observations, in input order.

    The chord contract is "distance travelled along the curve this result
    represents". For an orderer whose curve *is* the path through the visited
    observations -- the walk, the MST backbone -- that is the cumulative
    distance between consecutive ordered points, which is what this computes.

    An orderer that fits a separate smooth curve and projects onto it should not
    use this: projecting is not the same as summing along the ordering, and such
    an orderer has already paid for the projection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions
        Phase-space positions, full arrays in input order.
    indices
        The result's ``indices``: visited observations in order, ``-1``-padded.

    Returns
    -------
    Array, shape (n_obs,)
        Arc length per observation in **input order**. Unvisited observations
        carry ``nan``, matching the ``chord`` field's contract.
