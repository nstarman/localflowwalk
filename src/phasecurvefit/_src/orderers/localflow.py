class LocalFlowOrderer(AbstractOrderer):
    """Order tracers with the velocity-following local-flow walk.

    This is the primary way to run the walk, via the uniform orderer interface:
    ``pcf.order(positions, velocities, pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer())``. It is
    *not* what ``pcf.order`` runs with no orderer -- that is the MST | SOM
    default pipeline. ``order()`` handles ``direction="both"`` internally via
    ``combine_results``.

    The walk, with its momentum-weighted metric, is the algorithm of Nibauer et
    al. (2022); if you use it in published work, please cite that paper (see
    :doc:`/citation`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric_scale
        Metric-dependent scale parameter.
    config
        Neighbor-query configuration (metric + strategy).
    start_idx
        Index of the starting observation. ``None`` (the default) takes the
        start from ``init`` when the walk is chained after another orderer, and
        falls back to ``0`` when it is not.

        The walk has to be told where a curve *ends*, and picking that index by
        hand means knowing the answer in advance. An
        :class:`~phasecurvefit.orderers.MSTOrderer` finds the two tips itself --
        its ordering is the graph diameter, tip to tip -- so its first ordered
        observation is a genuine endpoint::

            (
                pcf.orderers.MSTOrderer(k=16, jump_cap=3.0)
                | pcf.orderers.LocalFlowOrderer()
            )

        An explicit ``start_idx`` always wins, chained or not.
    direction
        ``"forward"``, ``"backward"``, or ``"both"``.
    max_dist
        Maximum allowed neighbor distance.
    terminate_indices
        Indices that terminate the walk when reached.
    n_max
        Maximum number of iterations.
