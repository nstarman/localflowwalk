"""The MST-backbone orderer.

Orders tracers along a 1-D manifold via the longest path (graph diameter) of the
minimum spanning tree of a kNN graph. Unlike the velocity-following walk, it has
no progenitor and no forward/backward split: the graph diameter finds the two
tips itself, giving a clean tip-to-tip ordering. This is the algorithm of choice
for near-closed-loop / self-overlapping streams where the velocity field reverses
and a single walk cannot traverse the arc.

Velocity information is **opt-in** (pure-spatial is the default) via three
mechanisms, all reusing the phase-space notion of velocity alignment
``cos(v_i, v_j)`` (cf. ``AlignedMomentumDistanceMetric``):

1. *phase-space edge weights* (``velocity_weight``): edge weight
   ``||dq|| + velocity_weight * (1 - cos(v_i, v_j))`` — anti-parallel arms cost
   more, so the MST avoids bridging spatially-close arms that move oppositely;
2. *velocity-aware severing* (``sever_cos_threshold``): drop edges with
   ``cos(v_i, v_j) < threshold`` — cuts the reversal seam of a near-closed loop;
3. *tip orientation* (``orient_by_velocity``): flip the ordering so ``gamma``
   increases along the mean velocity.

The exact kNN is computed by the selected ``neighbors`` backend (default
``BucketKDTree``) and, for every JAX backend, the graph algorithms (MST,
components, diameter, edge-clip, bridging) run in pure JAX
(``phasecurvefit._src.graph``), so ``order()`` traces under ``jax.jit``,
``vmap`` and ``grad`` with no host callback. Only ``neighbors=SciPy()`` keeps
the eager, all-host SciPy pipeline. The *selection* the graph stage makes
(which edges, which nodes, in what order) is combinatorial and has no
meaningful gradient, so it runs on stop-gradiented inputs and returns only
indices. The backbone *coordinates* are then gathered from
``positions``/``velocities`` (``P[backbone_idx]``), so -- away from the
measure-zero set of points where the selection itself changes -- gradient flows
through them exactly as through any other data-dependent gather (e.g.
``x[jnp.argmax(x)]``): real w.r.t. the gathered values, zero w.r.t. the
(integer, non-differentiable) index that picked them.

    on_disconnected
        Policy when the graph splits into multiple components (a gap in the
        stream, or a ``jump_cap``/``sever_cos_threshold`` that is too tight):
        ``"raise"`` (default), ``"warn"`` (order the largest component, warn,
        leave the rest unvisited), ``"largest"`` (same, silently), or
        ``"connect"`` (join the pieces along their shortest links and order
        everything; the bridge links ignore ``jump_cap`` and velocity severing,
        which is what split the graph).
    edge_clip_sigma
        Optional outlier rejection by MST edge length. If not ``None``, robustly
        sigma-clip the backbone's *spatial* edge lengths in log space: cut edges
        longer than ``median * exp(edge_clip_sigma * 1.4826 * MAD(log L))``
        (never shorter than twice the median), split off the small components
        this isolates, and repeat (see ``edge_clip_max_iters``). Interlopers the
        MST threads in along one long edge fall away and are left unvisited
        (``indices == -1``); the rest of the stream is kept and reconnected, so a
        sparse but continuous tail is not rejected. ``None`` (default) disables
        clipping. Lower ``edge_clip_sigma`` clips more aggressively.
    edge_clip_max_iters
        Maximum sigma-clip iterations (default 5). Ignored when
        ``edge_clip_sigma`` is ``None``.
    neighbors
        The exact kNN backend (``phasecurvefit.neighbors``): ``BucketKDTree()``
        (default; JAX-native, traceable), ``BruteForce()``, ``JaxKD()``
        (optional dependency), or ``SciPy(workers=-1)`` (fastest on CPU, but
        host-only: it raises when its inputs are traced by jit/vmap/grad).

    Examples
    --------
    Order a simple 2D stream using the MST backbone:

    >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
    >>> import phasecurvefit as pcf

    >>> positions = {
    ...     "x": jnp.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]),
    ...     "y": jnp.array([0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]),
    ... }
    >>> velocities = {"x": jnp.ones(5), "y": jnp.full(5, 0.5)}

    >>> orderer = pcf.orderers.MSTOrderer(k=10, jump_cap=3.0)
    >>> result = pcf.order(positions, velocities, orderer)
    >>> result.indices
    Array([4, 3, 2, 1, 0], dtype=int32)

    For near-closed loops where the velocity field reverses, use
    ``velocity_weight`` to penalize edges between opposite-moving arms:

    >>> # Synthetic near-closed loop (two arms moving in opposite directions)
    >>> theta = jnp.linspace(0, 2 * jnp.pi, 100)
    >>> positions = {"x": jnp.cos(theta), "y": jnp.sin(theta)}
    >>> # Velocity tangent to the circle, but reversing at the crossing
    >>> velocities = {"x": -jnp.sin(theta), "y": jnp.cos(theta)}

    Use ``velocity_weight`` to down-weight edges between opposite-moving regions:

    >>> orderer = pcf.orderers.MSTOrderer(k=10, jump_cap=2.0, velocity_weight=1.0)
    >>> result = pcf.order(positions, velocities, orderer)
    >>> result.n_visited > 0  # Most points ordered
    Array(True, dtype=bool)

    Alternatively, use ``sever_cos_threshold`` to explicitly cut edges where
    velocities are anti-parallel:

    >>> orderer = pcf.orderers.MSTOrderer(k=10, jump_cap=2.0, sever_cos_threshold=0.0)
    >>> result = pcf.order(positions, velocities, orderer)

    The result includes a ``backbone`` polyline (the MST longest path) that
    ``__call__`` uses for smooth interpolation:

    >>> result.backbone is not None
    True
    >>> result.backbone["x"].shape
    (100,)

    Orient the ordering to increase along the mean velocity using
    ``orient_by_velocity``:

    >>> orderer = pcf.orderers.MSTOrderer(k=10, jump_cap=2.0, orient_by_velocity=True)
    >>> result = pcf.order(positions, velocities, orderer)

    Reject an interloper by MST edge length with ``edge_clip_sigma``. Here a lone
    point sits far off an otherwise clean line; clipping leaves it unvisited:

    >>> xs = jnp.concat([jnp.linspace(0.0, 9.0, 40), jnp.array([30.0])])
    >>> ys = jnp.concat([jnp.zeros(40), jnp.array([30.0])])
    >>> pos = {"x": xs, "y": ys}
    >>> vel = {"x": jnp.ones(41), "y": jnp.zeros(41)}
    >>> clipper = pcf.orderers.MSTOrderer(k=10, jump_cap=50.0, edge_clip_sigma=3.0)
    >>> result = pcf.order(pos, vel, clipper)
    >>> int(result.n_skipped)  # the lone interloper is rejected
